# Knight Travails

Knight Travails is a program that solves the Knight's shortest path problem on a chessboard. Given a starting position and a target position, the program calculates the minimum number of moves required for a knight to reach the target.

This is a project made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
